What is Magic Square:
In recreational mathematics and combinatorial design, a magic square is a square grid filled with distinct positive integers in the range such that each cell contains a different integer and the sum of the integers in each row, column and diagonal is equal.  


Here I have designed a GUI based in HTML CSS and Java Script.
